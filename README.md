This project introduces an accessible, user-friendly medical question-and-answer (Q&A) application. The primary objectives include tailoring health information to individual concerns and enhancing response quality through the integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The dataset, collected from diverse sources by Meditron, forms the foundation for the context-aware chatbot. Utilizing Hugging Face’s Instruct embeddings for vectorization and the powerful GPT-3.5 model, I implemented a streamlined process for efficient storage, retrieval, and generation of context-aware responses. Results demonstrate the chatbot’s strength in responsiveness, particularly when equipped with relevant information. Collaborative user input and contributions from healthcare professionals enriched the chatbot’s knowledge base, showcasing its potential in virtual healthcare assistance. The project signifies substantial progress, with avenues for future improvements outlined, promising continued advancements in virtual healthcare.
